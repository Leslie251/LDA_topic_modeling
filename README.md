Dependencies
-pandas
-nltk
-gensim
-googletrans

Functionality
-read_excel(file_path): Reads data from an Excel file and returns a pandas dataframe.
-download_stopwords(language): Downloads stopwords for a specific language and returns a list of stop words.
-translate_text(text, target_language): Translates text to a target language using the Googletrans library and returns the translated text.
-preprocess_text(df, stop_words): Preprocesses the text data by detecting non-English text, translating it to English, tokenizing the text, removing stop words and punctuation marks, and returning a list of preprocessed documents.
-apply_lda(texts): Applies the LDA topic modeling algorithm to the preprocessed text data using the Gensim library and prints the main topic and associated keywords in English, Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

Usage
-Install the required libraries using pip install.
-Save the text data in an Excel file with a column named 'chats'.
-Update the file_path variable in the read_excel function to point to the location of the Excel file.
-Run the Python script using a Python interpreter.

-The script will print the main topic and associated keywords in English, Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.
Note: The Googletrans library may have usage limits and may not always provide accurate translations. It is recommended to use a paid translation service for more accurate results.
