# LDA Topic Modeling

This code implements the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm. LDA is a statistical model that can be used to identify the topics in a document or corpus of documents. The code takes a corpus of text documents as input and outputs a list of topics, along with the keywords associated with each topic.

## Installation

To install the code, you will need to have Python 3 installed. You can install Python 3 from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can install the required packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the code, you will need to provide a corpus of text documents. The corpus can be a list of strings, a list of lists of strings, or a pandas DataFrame. Each document in the corpus should be a string of text.

Once you have a corpus of text documents, you can run the code by running the following command:

```
python lda.py <corpus_file>
```

where `<corpus_file>` is the path to the file containing the corpus of text documents.

The code will output a list of topics, along with the keywords associated with each topic. The output will be printed to the console.

## Example

The following is an example of how to use the code to identify the topics in a corpus of text documents.

```
# Create a corpus of text documents.
corpus = [
    "This is a document about the topic of machine learning.",
    "This is another document about the topic of natural language processing.",
    "This is a third document about the topic of artificial intelligence.",
]

# Run the code to identify the topics in the corpus.
python lda.py corpus.txt

# The output will be printed to the console.
```

The output of the code will be a list of topics, along with the keywords associated with each topic. The output will look something like this:

```
[
    ['machine learning', 'artificial intelligence', 'natural language processing'],
    ['data science', 'statistics', 'probability'],
    ['computer science', 'programming', 'software engineering'],
]
```

This output tells us that the first topic is about machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. The second topic is about data science, statistics, and probability. The third topic is about computer science, programming, and software engineering.
